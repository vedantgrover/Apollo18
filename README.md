Hey everyone! Freyr here from Discord. I have been working on Discord bots for the past 2 years now. All of them have been in Node.js.
But I know that I can do a better job from Java. So I have decided to restart my bot (previously known as Vicki the Robot) and create
Apollo18.

This bot will be a full multipurpose bot, including things from Moderation to Economy to maybe even a WEB DASHBOARD (still got to learn web development. might release late 2023)

I am beyond excited to start making bots again. I hope you enjoy!!
